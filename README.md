# JK-Stromprofis - Electrical services company website

JK-Stromprofis is a commercial website project developed in Next.js


## Project description

I have successfully designed, developed, and launched a website for an electrical service company, based on our goal of presenting them as professional, reliable, and easily accessible. With the newly created website, customers can conveniently access information about the company and contact them about the provided services, saving both time and effort.


## Technologies used

## Project challenges

This project presented several challenges. One was effectively presenting a wealth of information about the company's services without overwhelming the website visitors. This was addressed by designing an intuitive navigation system, with distinct sections for each service, which offered a clear and concise overview.

Moreover, ensuring the websiteâ€™s design aligned with the company's professional image. Throughout the project, I utilized Figma to create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, following the best UI/UX principles. The focus was on visually portraying the company's commitment to professional and reliable electrical services.

To develop the website, I employed Next.js, a lightning-fast framework known for its exceptional page loading speed. This ensures that users have a fast and frustration-free browsing experience, while also providing a significant boost to the overall SEO performance. As a result, the website is highly optimized for search engines, helping it rank higher in search results.

Lastly, dividing the project into milestones was a successful strategy to keep the development aligned with the client's vision and to manage the workload effectively. This solution fostered clear communication and mutual understanding with the client at every stage of the project.
